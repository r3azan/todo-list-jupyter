# todo-list-jupyter
Simple To-Do List app built with Python in Jupyter Notebook
# 📝 To-Do List Application (Python - Jupyter Notebook)

A simple command-line style To-Do List application implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook.  
The project demonstrates core Python programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, and basic error handling.

## ✨ Features
- Add new tasks
- Remove existing tasks
- View all tasks in a numbered list
- Count total number of tasks
- Input validation and basic error handling

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure
- todo_list.ipynb — Main notebook containing the application logic

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open Jupyter Notebook
2. Open `todo_list.ipynb`
